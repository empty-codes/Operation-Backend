# War Preparations (100 XP)

As you pass through the city of Rocaard, two blacksmiths, Cygnus and Lyra, approach you. “We know where this is headed. A confrontation with the Uncoded One’s forces,” Lyra says. Cygnus continues, “You’re going to need an army at your side—one prepared to do battle. We forge enchanted swords and will do everything we can to support this cause. We need the Power of Programming to flow unfettered too. We want to help, but we can’t equip an entire army without the help of a program to aid in crafting swords.” They describe the program they need, and you dive in to help.

## Objectives:

- Swords can be made out of any of the following materials: wood, bronze, iron, steel, and the rare binarium. Create an enumeration to represent the material type.
- Gemstones can be attached to a sword, which gives them strange powers through Cygnus and Lyra’s touch. Gemstone types include emerald, amber, sapphire, diamond, and the rare bitstone. Or no gemstone at all. Create an enumeration to represent a gemstone type.
- Create a `Sword` record with a material, gemstone, length, and crossguard width.
- In your main program, create a basic `Sword` instance made out of iron and with no gemstone. Then create two variations on the basic sword using `with` expressions.
- Display all three sword instances with code like `Console.WriteLine(original);`.
